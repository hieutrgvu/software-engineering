**1.7. Which two core concepts of Linux are containers based on?**

`Resolved by: Hieu Vu`

+ Linux kernel `namespaces`, such as process ID (pid) namespaces or network
(net) namespaces, allow Docker to encapsulate or sandbox processes that run
inside the container.

+ Control Groups `cgroups` make sure that containers cannot suffer from the
noisy-neighbor syndrome, where a single application running in a container
can consume most or all of the available resources of the whole Docker host.
Control Groups allow Docker to limit the resources, such as CPU time or the
amount of RAM, that each container is allocated.
