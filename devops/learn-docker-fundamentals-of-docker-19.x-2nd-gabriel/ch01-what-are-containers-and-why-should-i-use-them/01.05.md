B. False

`Resolved by: The book author`

The answer is B. Containers are useful for modern applications as well as to
containerize traditional applications. The benefits for an enterprise when
doing the latter are huge. Cost savings in the maintenance of legacy apps of
50% or more have been reported. The time between new releases of such legacy
applications could be reduced by up to 90%. These numbers have been publicly
reported by real enterprise customers.
