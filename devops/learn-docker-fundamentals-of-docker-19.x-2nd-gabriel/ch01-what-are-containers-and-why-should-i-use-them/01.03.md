+ Containers enable secure software supply chained based on encapsulation
using Linux namespaces and cgourps.

+ Containers are self-contained and can run on any systems, which support
containers.
+ Containers images are immutable, which is important for release management.
+ Containers  make it easy to simulate a production-like environment.
+ Containers are very lean compared to VMs, it is common to have many
containers running at the same time without overwhelming the laptop.
