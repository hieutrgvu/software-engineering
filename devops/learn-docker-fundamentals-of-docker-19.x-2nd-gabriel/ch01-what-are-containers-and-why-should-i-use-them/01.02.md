**1.2. In your own words, maybe by using analogies, explain what a container

`Resolved by: Hieu Vu`

A container is a blackbox and standardized. This standardized box can be loaded
on any standardized machines. Machines do not need to know what are in the
blackbox. We are in charge of loading our applications with their dependencies
in the container.
