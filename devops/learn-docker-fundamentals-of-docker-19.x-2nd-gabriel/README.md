# Learn Docker - Fundamentals of Docker 19.x

"Developers are faced with ever-increasing pressure to build, modify, test, and
deploy highly distributed applications in a high cadence. Operations engineers
are looking for a uniform deployment strategy that encompasses most or all of
their ever-growing portfolio of applications, and stakeholders want to keep
their total cost of ownership low. Docker containers combined with a container
orchestrator such as Kubernetes help them all to achieve these goals." (From
the book's author)
