`Resolved by: The book author`

A. True. Yes, with Docker for Windows, you can develop and run Linux containers.
It is also possible, but not discussed in this book, to develop and run native
Windows containers with this edition of Docker for Desktop. With the macOS
edition, you can only develop and run Linux containers.
