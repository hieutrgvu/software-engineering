5.1 State whether the following are true or false. If the answer is false,
explain why.
a) The default case is required in the switch selection statement.
b) The break statement is required in the default case of a switch selection
statement to exit the switch properly.
c) The expression ( x > y && a < b ) is true if either the expression x > y is
true or the expression a < b is true.
d) An expression containing the || operator is true if either or both of its
operands are true.

a) False. Cases not explicitly tested in a switch statement without a default
case are ignored, so default case is not required.
b) False. It depends on the position of default case. If it is the last case,
no break statements are required.
c) False. The expression ( x > y && a < b ) is true if both inside expressions
are true.
d) True.
