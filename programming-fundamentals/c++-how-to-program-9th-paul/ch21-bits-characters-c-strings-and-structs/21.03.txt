21.3 Write a single statement to accomplish each of the following. Assume that
variables c (which stores a character), x, y and z are of type int; variables
d, e and f are of type double; variable ptr is of type char * and arrays
s1[ 100 ] and s2[ 100 ] are of type char.

a) Convert the character stored in variable c to an uppercase letter. Assign
the result to variable c.

b) Determine if the value of variable c is a digit. Use the conditional
operator as shownin Figs. 21.18â€“21.20 to print " is a " or " is not a " when
the result is displayed.

c) Convert the string "1234567" to long, and print the value.

d) Determine whether the value of variable c is a control character. Use the
conditional operator to print " is a " or " is not a " when the result is
displayed.

e) Assign to ptr the location of the last occurrence of c in s1.

f) Convert the string "8.63582" to double, and print the value.

g) Determine whether the value of c is a letter. Use the conditional operator
to print " is a " or " is not a " when the result is displayed.

h) Assign to ptr the location of the first occurrence of s2 in s1.

i) Determine whether the value of variable c is a printing character. Use
the conditional operator to print " is a " or " is not a " when the result is
displayed.

j) Assign to ptr the location of the first occurrence in s1 of any character
from s2.

k) Assign to ptr the location of the first occurrence of c in s1.

l) Convert the string "-21" to int, and print the value.
