21.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following:
a) The bits in the result of an expression using the ___ operator are set to
one if the corresponding bits in each operand are set to one. Otherwise, the
bits are set to zero.
b) The bits in the result of an expression using the ___ operator are set to
one if at least one of the corresponding bits in either operand is set to one.
Otherwise, the bits are set to zero.
c) Keyword ___ introduces a structure declaration.
d) Keyword ___ is used to create asynonym for a previously defined data type.
e) Each bit in the result of an expression using the ___ operator is set to one
if exactly one of the corresponding bits in either operand is set to one.
f) The bitwise AND operator & is often used to ___ bits (i.e., to select
certain bits from a bit string while zeroing others).
g) The ___ and ___ operators are used to shift the bits of a value to the left
or to the right, respectively.
