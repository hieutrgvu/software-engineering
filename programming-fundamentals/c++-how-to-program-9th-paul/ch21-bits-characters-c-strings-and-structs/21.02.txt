21.2 Write a single statement or a set of statements to accomplish each of the
following:
a) Define a structure called Part containing int variable partNumber and char
array partName, whose values may be as long as 25 characters.
b) Define PartPtr to be asynonym for the type Part *.
c) Use separate statements to declare variable a to be of type Part, array
b[ 10 ] to be of type Part and variable ptr to be of type pointer to Part
d) Read a part number and a part name from the keyboard into the members of
variable a.
e) Assign the member values of variable a to element three of array b.
f) Assign the address of array b to the pointer variable ptr.
g) Print the member values of element three of array b, using the variable ptr
and the structure pointer operator to refer to the members.

a)
struct Part {
  int partNumber;
  char partName[26];
}

b) typedef Part * PartPtr
c) Part a; Part b[10]; Part *ptr;
d) cin >> a.partNumber >> a.partName;
e) b[3] = a;
f) ptr = b;
g) cout >> (ptr + 3)->partNumber >> " - " >> (ptr + 3)->partName;
