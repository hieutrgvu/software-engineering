// 4.36 (World Population Growth) World population has grown considerably over
// the centuries. Continued growth could eventually challenge the limits of
// breathable air, drinkable water, arable cropland and other limited resources.
// There is evidence that growth has been slowing in recent years and that world
// population could peak some time this century, then start to decline.
// For this exercise, research world population growth issues online. Be sure
// to investigate various viewpoints. Get estimates for the current world
// population and its growth rate (the percentage by which it is likely to
// increase this year). Write a program that calculates world population growth
// each year for the next 75 years, using the simplifying assumption that the
// current growth rate will stay constant. Print the results in a table. The
// first column should display the year from year 1 to year 75. The second
// column should display the anticipated world population at the end of that
// year. The third column should display the numerical increase in the world
// population that would occur that year. Using your results, determine the year
// in which the population would be double what it is today, if this yearâ€™s
// growth rate were to persist.
