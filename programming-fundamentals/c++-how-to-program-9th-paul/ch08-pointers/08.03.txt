8.3 For each of the following, write C++ statements that perform the specified
task. Assume that double-precision, floating-point numbers are stored in eight
bytes and that the starting address of the array is at location 1002500 in
memory. Each part of the exercise should use the results of previous parts
where appropriate.

a) Declare an array of type double called numbers with 10 elements, and
initialize the elements to the values 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, ..., 9.9. Assume that the
symbolic constant SIZE has been defined as 10.

b) Declare a pointer nPtr that points to a variable of type double.

c) Use a for statement to print the elements of array numbers using array
subscript notation. Print each number with one position of precision to the
right of the decimal point.

d) Write two separate statements that each assign the starting address of array
numbers to the pointer variable nPtr.

e) Use a for statement to print the elements of array numbers using pointer/
offset notation with pointer nPtr.

f) Use a for statement to print the elements of array numbers using pointer/
offset notation with the array name as the pointer.

g) Use a for statement to print the elements of array numbers using pointer/
subscript notation with pointer nPtr.

h) Refer to the fourth element of array numbers using array subscript notation,
pointer/offset notation with the array name as the pointer, pointer subscript
notation with nPtr and pointer/offset notation with nPtr.

i) Assuming that nPtr points to the beginning of array numbers, what address is
referenced by nPtr + 8? What value is stored at that location?

j) Assuming that nPtr points to numbers[5], what address is referenced by nPtr
after nPtr -= 4 is executed? Whatâ€™s the value stored at that location?

a) double numbers[SIZE] = { 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9 };
b) double *nPtr;
c) for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
     cout << fixed << setpresision(1) << right << numbers[i] << ' ';
d) nPtr = numbers;
   nPtr = &numbers[0];
e) for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
     cout << *(nPtr + i) << ' ';
f) for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
     cout << *(numbers + i) << ' ';
g) for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
     cout << nPtr[i] << ' ';
h) numbers[3]; *(numbers + 3); nPtr[3]; *(nPtr + 3);
i) The address referenced: 1002500 + 8*8 = 1002564.
   The value stored at above location: 8.8.
j) The address referenced: 1002500 + 8*5 - 8*4 = 1002508.
   The value stored at above location: 1.1.
