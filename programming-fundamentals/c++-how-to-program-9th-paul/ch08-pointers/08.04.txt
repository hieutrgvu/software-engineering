8.4 For each of the following, write a single statement that performs the
specified task. Assume that floating-point variables number1 and number2 have
been declared and that number1 has been initialized to 7.3. Assume that
variable ptr is of type char *. Assume that arrays s1 and s2 are each
100-element char arrays that are initialized with string literals.

a) Declare the variable fPtr to be a pointer to an object of type double.
b) Assign the address of variable number1 to pointer variable fPtr.
c) Print the value of the object pointed to by fPtr.
d) Assign the value of the object pointed to by fPtr to variable number2.
e) Print the value of number2.
f) Print the address of number1.
g) Print the address stored in fPtr. Is the value printed the same as the
address of number1?

a) double *fPtr;
b) fPtr = &number1;
c) cout << *fPtr;
d) number2 = *fPtr;
e) cout << number2;
f) cout << &number1;
g) cout << fPtr;
Yes. The value printed is the same as the address of number 1.
