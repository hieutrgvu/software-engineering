6.1 Answer each of the following:

b) A function is invoked with a(n) ___.
c) A variable known only within the function in which it’s defined is called
a(n) ___.
d) The ___ statement in a called function passes the value of an expression
back to the calling function.
e) The keyword ___ is used in a function header to indicate that a function does
not return a value or to indicate that a function contains no parameters.
f) An identifier's ___ is the portion of the program in which the identifier
can be used.
g) The three ways to return control from a called function to a caller are ___,
___ and ___.
h) A(n) ___ allows the compiler to check the number, types and order of the
arguments passed to a function.
i) Function ___ is used to produce random numbers.
j) Function ___ is used to set the random number seed to randomize the number
sequence generated by function rand.
k) The storage-class specifiers are mutable, ___, ___, ___ and ___.
l) Variables declared in a block or in the parameter list of a function are
assumed to be of storage class ___ unless specified otherwise.
m) Storage-class specifier ___ is a recommendation to the compiler to store a
variable in one of the computer’s registers.
n) A variable declared outside any block or function is a(n) ___ variable.
o) For a local variable in a function to retain its value between calls to the
function, it must be declared with the ___ storage-class specifier.
p) The six possible scopes of an identifier are ___, ___, ___, ___, ___ and ___.
q) A function that calls itself either directly or indirectly (i.e., through
another function) is a(n) ___ function.
r) A recursive function typically has two components—one that provides a means
for the recursion to terminate by testing for a(n) ___ case and one that
expresses the problem as a recursive call for a slightly simpler problem than
the original call.
s) It’s possible to have various functions with the same name that operate on
different types or numbers of arguments. This is called ___ function .
t) The ___ enables access to a global variable with the same name as a variable
in the current scope.
u) The ___ qualifier is used to declare read-only variables.
v) A function ___ enables a single function to be defined to perform a task on
many different data types.
