2.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
Assume the statement using std::cout; is used.
a) Comments cause the computer to print the text after the // on the screen when
the program is executed.
b) The escape sequence \n, when output with cout and the stream insertion
operator, causes the cursor to position to the beginning of the next line on
the screen.
c) All variables must be declared before they're used.
d) All variables must be given a type when they're declared.
e) C++ considers the variables number and NuMbEr to be identical.
f) Declarations can appear almost anywhere in the body of a C++ function.
g) The modulus operator (%) can be used only with integer operands.
h) The arithmetic operators *, /, %, + and â€“ all have the same level of
precedence.
i) A C++ program that prints three lines of output must contain three statements
using cout and the stream insertion operator.

a) False. Comments do not cause the computer to perform any action when the
program is run - they're ignored by the complier and do not cause any machine-
language object code to be generated.
b) True.
c) True.
d) True.
e) False. C++ is case sensitive.
f) True.
g) True.
h) False. *, /, and % have higher precedence than + and -.
i) False. The escape sequence \n can be used to fit all 3 lines in 1 statement.
