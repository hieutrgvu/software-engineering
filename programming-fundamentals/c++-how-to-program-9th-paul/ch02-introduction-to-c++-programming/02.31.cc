// 2.31 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites.
// Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you
// can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has
// other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic
// congestion. The application should input the following information and
// display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
// a) Total miles driven per day.
// b) Costpergallonofgasoline.
// c) Average miles per gallon.
// d) Parkingfeesperday.
// e) Tolls per day.
