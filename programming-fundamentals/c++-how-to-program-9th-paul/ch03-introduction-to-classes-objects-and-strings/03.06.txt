3.6 (Default Constructor) What's a default constructor? How are an object's
data members initialized if a class has only an implicitly defined default
constructor?

+ A constructor with no parameters is a default constructor. If a constructor
is not provided, the compiler provides a default constructor. Developer can also
define a default constructor explicitly.

+ The compiler implicitly creates a default constructor in a class that does
not define a constructor. Such a constructor does not initialize the class's
data members, but does call the default constructor for each data member that's
an object of another class. An uninitialized variable typically contains a
"garbage" value.
