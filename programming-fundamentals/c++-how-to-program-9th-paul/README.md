## How to check the answers
+ `.txt` file: use any editor or reader programs to view the content
+ For a single `.cc` file, compile and run it to check its result:
```
$ g++ -o {name}.cc {name}.out
$ ./{name}.out
```
+ For a folder, it depends on each kind of exercise. If it contains multiple
source files, it usually has a Makefile. Use Makefile to build (or clean),
then run the binary file to check the result.
```
$ make build
$ ./{name-of-folder}.out
$ make clean
```
