1.5 Briefly describe how integer variables are typically represented on a
computer. (Look up one's complement and two's complement arithmetic in an
introductory computer science textbook if you are not familiar with these.)

Integers are typically stored as an array of bits in a computer's memory. The
signed integers (i.e., the ones which have positive or negative values) have
their "leftmost" bit as the sign bit - when it's 0 - the integer is positive,
otherwise negative. The unsigned integers don't have this sign bit, so for the
same allocated space, an unsigned representation can store a "bigger" value
than a signed one.

For the Binary number (base-2) system, there are two types of complements:
+ 1's complement - simply invert the given number.
+ 2's complement - calculate 1's complement and add 1 to the LSB.

Signed numbers generally use 2's complement representation. Positive values are
stored as it is and negative values are stored in their 2's complement form.

This representation for integers qualifies as a data structure because it's
implementing an ADT of integers - in terms of a type and a set of operations on
that type.
