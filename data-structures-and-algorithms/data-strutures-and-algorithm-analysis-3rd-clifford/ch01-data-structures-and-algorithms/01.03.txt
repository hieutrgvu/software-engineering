1.3 Define an ADT for character strings. Your ADT should consist of typical
functions that can be performed on strings, with each function defined in terms
of its input and output. Then define two different physical representations
for strings.

Character strings are simply a sequence of characters. Strings are an essential
component of almost any computer program as they are the only means of storing
textual information in the program. Strings should support the following
functionalities:
+ concatenation: Given two strings, give back the joined form of the strings.
+ find: Given a string and a character (or even a 'sub-string'), return the
position of the character (or the substring), if present, within the string.
+ sizeof: Given a string, return the number of characters

Following are two physical representation of strings:
+ Assign a byte value (or a block of multiple byte values) to every character
and then store a string as an array of such byte values. Retrieval of the actual
textual data from these byte values should be a straightforward task.
+ Create a list of characters, each node contains a character and a pointer to
the next node.
