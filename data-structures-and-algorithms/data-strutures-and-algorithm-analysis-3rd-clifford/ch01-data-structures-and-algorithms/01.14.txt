1.14 How would you go about comparing two proposed algorithms for sorting an
array of integers? In particular,
(a) What would be appropriate measures of cost to use as a basis for comparing
the two sorting algorithms?
(b) What tests or analysis would you conduct to determine how the two
algorithms perform under these cost measures?

The cost of a solution is the amount of resources that the solution consumes.
A solution is said to be efficient if it solves the problem within the required
resource constraints. A solution is sometimes said to be efficient if it
requires fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of whether it
meets any particular requirements.

(a) space and time
(b) Given a set of data:
+ Space: Calculate how many memory is used.
+ Time: Choose the operations taking major jobs and calculate their iteration.
