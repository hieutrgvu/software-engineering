1.7 Imagine that you have been assigned to implement a sorting program. The goal
is to make this program general purpose, in that you don't want to define in
advance what record or key types are used. Describe ways to generalize a simple
sorting algorithm (such as insertion sort, or any other sort you are familiar
with) to support this generalization.

All sorting functions require the objects to compare and the comparing operator
for this object type. In C++, we can use template to represent an undetermined
type (or class), and implement a comparing function for 2 objects. The sorting
functions do not need to know how two objects are compared. They just need to
know which object is "larger".
