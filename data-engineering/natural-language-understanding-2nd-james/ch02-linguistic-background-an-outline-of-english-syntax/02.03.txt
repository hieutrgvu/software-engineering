2.3 A very useful test for determining the syntactic role of words and phrases
is the conjunction test. Conjunctions, such as and and or, tend to join together
two phrases of the same type. For instance, you can conjoin nouns, as in the man
and woman; noun phrases, as in the angry men and the large dogs; and adjective
phrases, as in the cow, angry and confused, broke the gate. In each of the
following sentences, identify the type of phrase being conjoined, and underline
each phrase.
    He was tired and hungrier than a herd of elephants.
    We have never walked home or to the store from here.
    The dog returned quickly and dropped the stick.
