**12.10. What is a temporary table?**

Temporary tables allow you to store temporary query results that can be used
during a query session. A temporary table can only be used in your current
session. No one else can use them except you. These kinds of tables are useful
when you have a complicated or long-running query whose results you want to
use in a session. This way, you won't have to keep running the same query over
and over, but instead, store the results and query that table. *(page 413)*
