**12.3. What is a variable?**

A variable lets you store a single data value that can be used during your
session's queries. You can only store a limited set of data types in a variable.
These include string, integer, decimal, float, or NULL. If you use a different
type in your variable, it will be converted into one of the permitted types
listed previously. *(page 377)*
