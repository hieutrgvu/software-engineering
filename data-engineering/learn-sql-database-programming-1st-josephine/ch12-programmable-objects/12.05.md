**12.5. What is a stored procedure?**

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements stored in a database. It could be
just one SQL statement or many statements. With the help of this, you can reuse
certain pieces of code. This can particularly be helpful when you are grouping
business logic into a set of queries that will need to be run over and over
again. *(page 379)*
