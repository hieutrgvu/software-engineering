**8.6. What is an SQL transaction?**

A SQL transaction is a grouping of one or more changes to the database.
Transactions help ensure a consistent state in your database. The common
terms in SQL transactions are COMMIT and ROLLLBACK. Commit makes the
changes permanent and rollback cancels the changes. *(page 269)*
