**11.7. What is locking?**

Locking is what happens when a query runs against a database. There are read
locks and write locks:
+ Read locks: Allow other queries reading data (SELECT) to read as well.
+ Write locks: Other queries can't read or write data until the write (INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE) query is complete.
