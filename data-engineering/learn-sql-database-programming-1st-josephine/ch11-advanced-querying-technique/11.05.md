**11.5. What is CTE?**

A common table expression (CTE) is a container for a single SQL statement that
will allow you to query a temporary result set. A CTE allows you to create
complex queries in a more readable way. It may be beneficial to use a CTE
instead of subqueries because it's easier to read and understand later. CTEs
can also be used instead of creating a view. To create a view, you need elevated
permissions in a database, but you won't need any additional permissions to use
a CTE. *(page 352)*
