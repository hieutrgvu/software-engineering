**11.2. What's the difference between correlated and non-correlated
subqueries?**

Non-correlated:
+ The inner query doesn't depend on the outer query.
+ Can run as a standalone query
+ Executed only once
+ Executed before the outer query
+ Can't be used instead of JOIN on the outer query

Correlated:
+ Inner query depends on the outer query
+ Can't run as a standalone query
+ Executed once for each row selected in the outer query
+ Executed after the outer query
+ Can be used instead of JOIN on the outer query, but will be slower than JOIN
