# Learn SQL Database Programming
**Query and Manipulate Databases from Popular Relational Database Servers
Using SQL**

"SQL is a powerful querying language used to store, manipulate, and retrieve
data, and is one of the most popular languages used by developers to query and
analyze data efficiently. If you're looking for a comprehensive introduction to
SQL, Learn SQL Database Programming will help you to get up to speed with using
SQL to streamline your work in no time. Starting with an overview of relational
database management systems, this book will show you how to set up and use MySQL
Workbench and design a database using practical examples. You'll also discover
how to query and manipulate data with SQL programming using MySQL Workbench.
As you advance, you'll create a database, query single and multiple tables, and
modify data using SQL querying. This SQL book covers advanced SQL techniques,
including aggregate functions, flow control statements, error handling, and
subqueries, and helps you process your data to present your findings. Finally,
you'll implement best practices for writing SQL and designing indexes and
tables." (From the book's author)
