    + ALTER: This is used to alter a database or objects in a database.
    + DROP: This is used to delete a database or objects in a database.

+ Use DML commands to query and modify data:
    + SELECT: This is used to retrieve data from a database.
    + INSERT: This is used to insert data into a database.
    + UPDATE: This is used to update data in a database.
    + DELETE: This is used to remove data from a database.

    + REVOKE: This is used to take access away from a user.
    + COMMIT: This is used to save changes in a transaction.
    + ROLLBACK: This is used to remove the saved changes in a transaction.
