**1.9. What is the main advantage of MySQL?**

MySQL is commonly used in conjunction with PHP web applications. MySQL is a
great choice for organizations that need a good RDMS but have a tight budget.
The advantages of MySQL are that it's available for free, it offers a lot of
functionality for system and database administrators, it's easy to use and
implement, and it's fast and stable.
