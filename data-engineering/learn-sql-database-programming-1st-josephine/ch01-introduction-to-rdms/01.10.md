**1.10. What is the main disadvantage of Oracle and SQL Server?**

The disadvantages of **Oracle** are that licensing is expensive and it may
require significant database administrator resources to maintain it after
installation.

The disadvantages of **SQL Server** are that licensing is expensive, especially
for the Enterprise edition, and not all features are included in all editions,
such as some high-availability options and partitioning.
