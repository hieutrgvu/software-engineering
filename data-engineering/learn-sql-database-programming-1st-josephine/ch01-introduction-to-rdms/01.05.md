**1.5. What are the levels of database normalization?**

The first three levels of database normalization are:
+ The first normal form (1NF): has single (atomic) valued attributes/columns;
eliminates repeating groups
+ The second normal form (2NF): complies 1NF; should not have partial dependency
+ The third normal form (3NF): complies 2NF; should not have transitive
dependency
