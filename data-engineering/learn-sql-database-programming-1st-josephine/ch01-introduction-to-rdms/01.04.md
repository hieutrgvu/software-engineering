**1.4. What are the reasons to normalize a database?**

Database normalization is the process of putting your raw data into tables using
rules to avoid redundant data, optimize database performance, and ensure data
integrity. Without proper normalization, not only can you have data redundancy,
which uses additional storage space, but it can be more difficult to update and
maintain the database without data loss.
