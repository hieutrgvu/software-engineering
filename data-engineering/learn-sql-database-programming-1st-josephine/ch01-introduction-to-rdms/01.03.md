**1.3. What are the elements of a SQL statement?**

The SQL language comprises several elements:
+ Queries that retrieve data based on specific criteria.
+ Clauses that are components of statements or queries.
+ Predicates that are logical conditions that evaluate to true or false. These
help you to narrow down the results of your queries.
+ Expressions that produce either scalar values or tables of columns and rows.
Expressions are a part of predicates.
+ Statements that are queries run against a database, comprised of clauses and,
optionally, expressions and predicates.
+ White space that is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it
easier to format for readability because you don't have to worry so much about
particular spacing for the SQL to run correctly.


Example SQL statement (or query):
```
                                        expression
                                            |
clause -->    SELECT  column1       +-------+------+
clause -->    FROM    table         |              |
clause -->    WHERE   column2   =   'specific value'
                      |                            |
                      +-------------+--------------+
                                    |
                                predicate
```
