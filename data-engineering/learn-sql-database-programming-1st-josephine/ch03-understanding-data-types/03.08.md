**3.8. Why do you need to be careful when choosing data types?**

+ If you choose a data type that is too large for the data it will hold, it
will cause extra stress for your database because you will be using additional
storage. The less storage you use, the more data you can have in memory (RAM).
This will increase your database performance.
+ If you choose a data type that is too small for the data, this will cause
your data to be truncated upon insert, or to have failures upon insertion
because the data type won't allow those sizes of data to be inserted.
