**3.9. What data type would you use to store zip codes?**

International ZIP codes can be a mess. They can be of varying lengths with
various different formats. Some will have spaces. Some will be completely
numerical. Some countries donâ€™t even have ZIP codes  (the Republic of Ireland,
for example). To play it safe, you can store ZIP codes in a VARCHAR(20) column.
