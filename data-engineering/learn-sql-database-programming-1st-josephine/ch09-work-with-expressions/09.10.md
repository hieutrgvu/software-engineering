**9.10. What kinds of generated columns can you create?**

+ Virtual: Column values aren't stored on disk and therefore don't use any
storage. They are evaluated when the rows are read with a query. They only
support secondary indexes, so you can't place this column in a primary key.
This is explained next, with the GENERATED ALWAYS AS syntax.

+ Stored: Column values are stored on insert and update, and therefore take
storage on disk. Stored generated columns can have indexes placed on them.
This is explained next, with the GENERATED ALWAYS AS with STORED syntax.
