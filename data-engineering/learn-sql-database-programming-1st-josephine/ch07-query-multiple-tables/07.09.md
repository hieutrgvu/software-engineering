**7.9. How do you accomplish an intersection query in MySQL?**

MySQL doesn't support the INTERSECT SQL operator, but there is a workaround
with a join. This can be done with DISTINCT and INNER JOIN. The below example
shows you how to do this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.playerid
FROM lahmansbaseballdb.batting b
INNER JOIN lahmansbaseballdb.appearances a
ON a.playerid = b.playerid
ORDER BY a.playerid;
```
