**7.3. What is a table alias, and how do you use it?**

Aliases are the temporary names given to table or column for the purpose of
a particular SQL query. It is used when name of column or table is used other
than their original names, but the modified name is only temporary.
*(geeksforgeeks)*

+ Aliases are created to make table or column names more readable.
+ The renaming is just a temporary change and table name does not change
in the original database.
+ Aliases are useful when table or column names are big or not very readable.
+ These are preferred when there are more than one table involved in a query.

Basic syntax: `dbname.tablename AS alias`
