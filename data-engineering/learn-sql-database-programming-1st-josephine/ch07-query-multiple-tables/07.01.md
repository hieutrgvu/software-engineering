**7.1. Which types of table joins exist?**

+ Inner join: returns only matching records from each joined table.

+ Outer join:
    + Left outer join: includes all rows from the left table and any matching
    rows between the left and right tables.
    + Right outer join: all rows from the right table and any matching rows
    between the right and left tables.
    + Full outer join: includes all rows from both the left and right tables.
    This type of join is not available in MySQL.

+ Cross join: return a combination of every row from two tables.

+ Natural join: associate columns of the same name in the joined tables with
each other. It's similar to an inner join or left outer join, but you don't
specify the join columns.

+ Self join: join a table to itself.
