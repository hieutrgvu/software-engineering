**7.7. What is a CROSS JOIN?**

A CROSS JOIN is like an INNER JOIN without the ON clause. It winds up producing
results that are like multiplying each table with the other table. This is also
referred to as a Cartesian result. A CROSS JOIN will return a combination of
every row from two tables. This join will result in a lot of rows returned.
It may result in your query never returning results because it's too intensive
for the database system to return the results. *(page 231)*
