**7.8. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?**

+ UNION: This removes duplicate rows without using DISTINCT in the SELECT
statements.
+ UNION ALL: This does not remove duplicate rows, and they will remain in the
final result. This will perform faster than UNION because it doesn't have to
remove duplicates.
