**4.8. What's the difference between a clustered and a nonclustered index?**

+ Clustered indexes store the data in order, so whatever columns you choose in
a clustered index, that's the way the data will be sorted in a table. The data
is stored physically on disk in the order of the clustered index. A clustered
index can be viewed as a tree built on top of a table. The columns (key) that
you place in the clustered index determines the order of the rows in the table.

+ Non-clustered: Nonclustered indexes don't sort the data. They instead use
pointers to the physical data to quickly locate the data when the index is used
to query data. You can have multiple nonclustered indexes on a table, but you
need to be careful not to create too few or too many because your queries can
be slowed down either way.
