**4.10. Does the order of columns in an index matter?**

Yes. The order of the columns in indexes matters. For example, if you wanted to
sort your query data only on yearid, but your index is ordered by managerid and
then yearid, then your query won't be as performant. If you need to sort using
yearid most of the time, then you should have an index that has yearid as the
first column in the index. *(page 137)*
