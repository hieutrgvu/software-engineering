**4.5. What are natural and surrogate primary keys?**

With a natural key, you are using unique columns, and the data in those columns
exists outside the database (that is, in the business world). With a surrogate
key, you are creating a column to hold a unique value for each row, and that
value isn't used anywhere outside the database. *(page 121)*
