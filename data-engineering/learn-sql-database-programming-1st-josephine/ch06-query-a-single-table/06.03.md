**6.3. Why should you avoid using SELECT * in a query?**

Avoid using SELECT * in a query. Since this selects all columns in a table,
it is considered more expensive than if you specify the columns you need.
Expensive means that it takes more server resources to return your query
results, and when you have many queries executing on a server, you want them
to use the minimum resources required. *(page 171)*
