5.7 Many CPU-scheduling algorithms are parameterized. For example, the RR
algorithm requires a parameter to indicate the time slice. Multilevel feedback
queues require parameters to define the number of queues, the scheduling
algorithms for each queue, the criteria used to move processes between queues,
and so on.

These algorithms are thus really sets of algorithms (for example, the set of RR
algorithms for all time slices, and so on). One set of algorithms may include
another (for example, the FCFS algorithm is the RR algorithm with an infinite
time quantum). What (if any) relation holds between the following pairs of
algorithm sets?

a. Priority and SJF
b. Multilevel feedback queues and FCFS
c. Priority and FCFS
d. RR and SJF

a. The SJF algorithm is a special case of the general priority-scheduling
algorithm. The priority can be internal, e.g. time limits, memory and ratio
between I/O burst versus CPU burst, or external, e.g. the importance of the
process. An SJF algorithm is simply a priority algorithm where the priority is
the inverse of the (predicted) next CPU burst.

b. The lowest level of MLFQ is FCFS.

c. FCFS gives the highest priority to the job having been in existence the
longest.

d. None.
