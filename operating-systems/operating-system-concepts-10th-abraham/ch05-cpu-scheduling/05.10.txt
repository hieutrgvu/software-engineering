5.10 The traditional UNIX scheduler enforces an inverse relationship between
priority numbers and priorities: the higher the number, the lower the priority.
The scheduler recalculates process priorities once per second using the
following function:

        Priority = (recent CPU usage / 2) + base

where base = 60 and recent CPU usage refers to a value indicating how often a
process has used the CPU since priorities were last recalculated.

Assume that recent CPU usage for process P1 is 40, for process P2 is 18, and for
process P3 is 10. What will be the new priorities for these three processes when
priorities are recalculated? Based on this information, does the traditional
UNIX scheduler raise or lower the relative priority of a CPU-bound process?

   | New priority
---|-----------------
P1 | 40 / 2 + 60 = 80
P2 | 18 / 2 + 60 = 69
P3 | 10 / 2 + 60 = 65

The scheduler lowers the relative priority of CPU-bound processes. The recent
CPU usage in priority eqution is devided by 2, which means the more CPU burst
is, the larger amount of priority decreases.
