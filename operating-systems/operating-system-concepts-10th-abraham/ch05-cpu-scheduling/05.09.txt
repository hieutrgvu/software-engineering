5.9 Distinguish between PCS and SCS scheduling.

On systems implementing the many-to-one and many-to-many models, the thread
library schedules user-level threads to run on an available lightweight process
(LWP). This scheme is known as process-contention scope (PCS), since competition
for the CPU takes place among threads belonging to the same process.

To decide which kernel-level thread to schedule onto a CPU, the kernel uses
system-contention scope (SCS). Competition for the CPU with SCS scheduling takes
place among all threads in the system.

On systems using either many-to-one or many-to-many, the two scheduling models
are fundamentally different. On systems using one-to-one, PCS and SCS are the
same.
