1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function as a
rudimentary form of protection (security)?

A bit, called the mode bit, is added to the hardware of the computer to
indicate the current mode: kernel (0) or user (1). With the mode bit, we can
distinguish between a task that is executed on behalf of the operating system
and one that is executed on behalf of the user.

The dual mode of operation provides us with the means for protecting the
operating system from errant usersâ€”and errant users from one another. We
accomplish this protection by designating some of the machine instructions
that may cause harm as privileged instructions. The hardware allows privileged
instructions to be executed only in kernel mode. If an attempt is made to
execute a privileged instruction in user mode, the hardware does not execute
the instruction but rather treats it as illegal and traps it to the operating
system
