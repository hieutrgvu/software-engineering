1.13 Consider a computing cluster consisting of two nodes running a database.
Describe two ways in which the cluster software can manage access to the data
on the disk. Discuss the benefits and disadvantages of each.

+ Clustering can be structured asymmetrically or symmetrically.

+ In asymmetric clustering, one machine is in hot-standby mode while the other
is running the applications. The hot-standby host machine does nothing but
monitor the active server. If that server fails, the hot-standby host becomes
the active server. This is appropriate for providing redundancy.However, it does
not utilize the potential processing power of both hosts.

+ In symmetric clustering, two or more hosts are running applications and are
monitoring each other. This structure is obviously more efficient, as it uses
all of the available hardware. However, it does require that more than one
application be available to run. The difficulty implementing parallel clusters
is providing some form of distributed locking mechanism for files on the
shared disk.
