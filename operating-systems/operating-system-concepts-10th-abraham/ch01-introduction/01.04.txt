1.4 Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider
whether the operating system should include applications such as web browsers
and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it should not, and support
your answers.

Applications such as web browsers and email tools are performing an increasingly
important role in modern desktop computer systems. To fulfill this role, they
should be incorporated as part of the operating system. By doing so, they can
provide better performance and better integration with the rest of the system.
In addition, these important applications can have the same look-and-feel as the
operating system software.

A lesson from Microsoft: In 1998, the United States Department of Justice
filed suit against Microsoft, in essence claiming that Microsoft included too
much functionality in its operating systems and thus prevented application
vendors from competing. (For example, a web browser was an integral part of
Microsoftâ€™s operating systems.) As a result, Microsoft was found guilty of using
its operating-system monopoly to limit competition. Therefore, an operating
system should be the minimal software that creates environment for and control
user applications. If needed, users can install the extra tools like browsers,
mail applications, etc.
