+ Open-source operating systems have many people working on and debugging them.
They are ease of access and distribution. Therefor, they enable students to use
source code as a learning tool. They can modify programs and explore mature,
full-featured operating systems, compilers, tools, user interfaces, and other
types of programs. Another advantage of working with open-source operating
systems is their diversity.

+ Some open source operating systems do not offer paid support programs. Some
companies avoid open source projects because they need paid support, so that
they have some entity to hold accountable if there is a problem or they need
help fixing an issue. A lack of discipline in the coding of open source
operating systems means that backward compatiblity is lacking making upgrades
difficult, and that the frequent release cycle exacerbates these issues by
forcing users to upgrade frequently.
