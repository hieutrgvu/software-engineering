1.18 Many SMP systems have different levels of caches; one level is local to
each processing core, and another level is shared among all processing cores.
Why are caching systems designed this way?

The benefit is that many processes can run simultaneously, N processes can run
if there are N CPUs, without causing performance to deteriorate significantly.
However, since the CPUs are separate, one may be sitting idle while another is
overloaded, resulting in inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can be avoided if
the processors share certain data structures. A multiprocessor system of this
form will allow processes and resources—such as memory—to be shared dynamically
among the various processors and can lower the workload variance among the
processors.
