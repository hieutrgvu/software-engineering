1.10 Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve? What
 problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the device for which
it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk), why not make it that
large and eliminate the device?

+ Caches are useful because they can increase the speed of the average memory
access, and they do so without taking up as much physical space as the lower
elements of the memory hierarchy.

+ Caches solve the big speed gap between CPU and main memory.

+ Caches introduce the problems about (coherency and consistency assurance). The
same data may appear in different levels of the storage system.

+ Caches are expensive and volatile memory.
