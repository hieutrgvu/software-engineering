1.17 Some computer systems do not provide a privileged mode of operation in
hardware. Is it possible to construct a secure operating system for these
computer systems? Give arguments both that it is and that it is not possible.

An operating system for a machine of this type would need to remain in control
(or monitor mode) at all times. This could be accomplished by two methods:

+ Software interpretation of all user programs (like some BASIC, Java, and LISP
systems, for example). The software interpreter would provide, in software, what
the hardware does not provide.

+ Require meant that all programs be written in high-level languages so that all
object code is compiler-produced. The compiler would generate (either in-line
or by function calls) the protection checks that the hardware is missing.
