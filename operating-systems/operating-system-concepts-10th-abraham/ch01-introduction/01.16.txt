1.16 Direct memory access is used for high-speed I/O devices in order to avoid
increasing the CPUâ€™s execution load.
a. How does the CPU interface with the device to coordinate the transfer?
b. How does the CPU know when the memory operations are complete?
c. The CPU is allowed to execute other programs while the DMA controller is
transferring data. Does this process interfere with the execution of the user
programs? If so, describe what forms of interference are caused.

a. The CPU can initiate a DMA operation by writing values into special
registers that can be independently accessed by the device. After setting up
buffers, pointers, and counters for the I/O device, the device controller
transfers an entire block of data directly to or from the device and main
memory, with no intervention by the CPU.

b. Only one interrupt is generated per block, to tell the device driver that
the operation has completed, rather than the one interrupt per byte generated
for low-speed devices.

c. Both the device and the CPU can be accessing memory simultaneously. The
memory controller provides access to the memory bus in a fair manner to these
two entities. A CPU might therefore be unable to issue memory operations at
peak speeds since it has to compete with the device in order to obtain access
to the memory bus.
