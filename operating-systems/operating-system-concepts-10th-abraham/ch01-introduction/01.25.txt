systems?

Peer-to-peer is useful because services are distributed across a collection of
peers, rather than having a single, centralized server. Peer-to-peer provides
fault tolerance and redundancy. Also, because peers constantly migrate, they can
provide a level of security over a server that always exists at a known location
on the Internet. Peer-to-peer systems can also potentially provide higher
network bandwidth because you can collectively use all the bandwidth of peers,
rather than the single bandwidth that is available to a single server.
