1.21 Discuss, with examples, how the problem of maintaining coherence of cached
data manifests itself in the following processing environments:
a. Single-processor systems
b. Multiprocessor systems
c. Distributed systems

a. In single-processor systems, the memory needs to be updated when a processor
issues updates to cached values. These updates can be performed immediately or
in a lazy manner.

b. In a multiprocessor system, different processors might be caching the same
memory location in its local caches. When updates are made, the other cached
locations need to be invalidated or updated.

c. In distributed systems, consistency of cached memory values is not an issue.
However, consistency problems might arise when a client caches file data.
