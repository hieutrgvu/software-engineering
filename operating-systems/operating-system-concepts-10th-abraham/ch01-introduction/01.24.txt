Compared to desktop and laptop computers, mobile systems gave up screen size,
memory capacity, and overall functionality in return for handheld mobile access
to services such as e-mail and web browsing. The memory capacity and processing
speed of mobile devices are more limited than those of PCs. Because power
consumption is such a concern, mobile devices often use processors that are
smaller, are slower, and offer fewer processing cores than processors found on
traditional desktop and laptop computers.
