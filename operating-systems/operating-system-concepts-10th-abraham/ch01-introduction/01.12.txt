1.12 How do clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems? What is
required for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperate to provide a
highly available service?

+ Clustered systems gather together multiple CPUs. They differ from the
multiprocessor systems in that they are composed of two or more individual
systems or nodes joined together; each node is typically a multicore system.

+ A layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes. Each node can monitor
one or more of the others (over the network). If the monitored machine fails,
the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the
applications that were running on the failed machine. The users and clients of
the applications see only a brief interruption of service.
