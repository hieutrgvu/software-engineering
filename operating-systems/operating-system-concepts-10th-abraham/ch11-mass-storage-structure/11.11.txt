11.11 None of the disk-scheduling disciplines, except FCFS, is truly fair
(star- vation may occur).

a. Explain why this assertion is true.
b. Describe a way to modify algorithms such as SCAN to ensure fairness.
c. Explain why fairness is an important goal in a multi-user systems.
d. Give three or more examples of circumstances in which it is important that
the operating system be unfair in serving I/O requests.

a. Because disk scheduling will serve the request having higher priority, which
depends on its policy. Therefore, the newer request may be served before older
requets.

b. All requests older than some predetermined age could be “forced” to the top
of the queue, and an associated bit for each could be set to indicate that no
new request could be moved ahead of these requests.

c. Prevent long time responses.

d. Paging and swapping should take priority over user requests. It may be
desirable for other kernel-initiated I/O, such as the writing of file system
metadata, to take precedence over user I/O. If the kernel supports real-time
process priorities, the I/O requests of those processes should be favored.
