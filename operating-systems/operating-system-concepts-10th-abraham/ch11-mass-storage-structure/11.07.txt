11.7 It is sometimes said that tape is a sequential-access medium, whereas a
hard disk is a random-access medium. In fact, the suitability of a storage
device for random access depends on the transfer size. The term streaming
transfer rate denotes the rate for a data transfer that is underway, excluding
the effect of access latency. In contrast, the effective transfer rate is the
ratio of total bytes to total seconds, including overhead time such as access
latency.

Suppose we have a computer with the following characteristics: the level-2
cache has an access latency of 8 nanoseconds and a streaming transfer rate of
800 megabytes per second, the main memory has an access latency of 60
nanoseconds and a streaming transfer rate of 80 megabytes per second, the hard
disk has an access latency of 15 milliseconds and a streaming transfer rate of
5 megabytes per second, and a tape drive has an access latency of 60 seconds
and a streaming transfer rate of 2 megabytes per second.

a. Random access causes the effective transfer rate of a device to decrease,
because no data are transferred during the access time. For the disk described,
what is the effective transfer rate if an average access is followed by a
streaming transfer of (1) 512 bytes, (2) 8 kilobytes, (3) 1 megabyte, and
(4) 16 megabytes?

b. The utilization of a device is the ratio of effective transfer rate to
streaming transfer rate. Calculate the utilization of the disk drive for each
of the four transfer sizes given in part a.

c. Suppose that a utilization of 25 percent (or higher) is considered
acceptable. Using the performance figures given, compute the smallest transfer
size for a disk that gives acceptable utilization.

d. Complete the following sentence: A disk is a random-access device for
transfers larger than ___ bytes and is a sequential-access device for
smaller transfers.

e. Compute the minimum transfer sizes that give acceptable utilization for cache, memory, and tape.

f. When is a tape a random-access device, and when is it a sequential-access
device?

a.
512B: Transfer time = latency + transfer size (TS) / Transfer rate (STR)
      = 15ms + 512B/5MB_per_sec = 15.0097ms.

      Effective transfer rate (ETR) = Transfer size / Transfer time (TT)
      = 512B/15.0097ms = 33.12KB/sec

8KB:  ETR = 0.47MB/sec
1MB:  ETR = 4.65MB/sec
16MB: ETR = 4.98MB/sec

b.
512B: 33.12KB_per_sec / 5MB_per_sec = 0.46%
8KB:  0.47MB_per_sec / 5MB_per_sec = 9.4%
1MB:  4.65MB_per_sec / 5MB_per_sec = 93%
16MB: 4.98MB_per_sec / 5MB_per_sec = 99.6%

c.
Min ETR = 25% * TR = 1.25MB_per_sec
=> Min TS = 25KB

d. K bytes which is greater than disk block size

e.
Calculate for cache:
STR = 800MB, ETR = 200, latency = 8 * 10^−9.
200 (XMB/800 + 8 X 10^−9) = XMB.
.25XMB + 1600 * 10−9 = XMB.
X = 2.24 bytes.

Calculate for memory:
STR = 80MB, ETR = 20, L = 60 * 10−9.
20 (XMB/80 + 60 * 10−9) = XMB.
.25XMB + 1200 * 10−9 = XMB.
X = 1.68 bytes.

Calculate for tape:
STR = 2MB, ETR = .5, L = 60s.
.5 (XMB/2 + 60) = XMB.
.25XMB + 30 = XMB.
X = 40MB.

f. It depends upon how it is being used. Assume we are using the tape to
restore a backup. In this instance, the tape acts as a sequential-access device
where we are sequentially reading the contents of the tape. As another example,
assume we are using the tape to access a variety of records stored on the tape.
In this instance, access to the tape is arbitrary and hence considered random.
