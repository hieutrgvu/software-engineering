9.3 Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts: code
and data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or
data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base–limit register pairs are
provided: one for instructions and one for data. The instruction base–limit
register pair is automatically read-only, so programs can be shared among
different users. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.

Advantages:
+ Save memory space due to code sharing
+ Read-only attribute and base-limit register pair can protect code against
erroneous modification.

Disadvantages:
+ the code and data must be separated, which is usually adhered to in a
generated code.
+ Face with external fragmentation if use contiguous memory allocation.
