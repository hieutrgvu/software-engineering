9.12 Consider the following process for generating binaries. A compiler is used
to generate the object code for individual modules, and a linker is used to
combine multiple object modules into a single program binary. How does the
linker change the binding of instructions and data to memory addresses? What
information needs to be passed from the compiler to the linker to facilitate
the memory-binding tasks of the linker?

The linker has to replace unresolved symbolic addresses with the actual
addresses associated with the variables in the final program binary. In order
to perform this, the modules should keep track of instructions that refer to
unresolved symbols. During linking, each module is assigned a sequence of
addresses in the overall program binary and when this has been performed,
unresolved references to symbols exported by this binary could be patched in
other modules since every other module would contain the list of instructions
that need to be patched.
