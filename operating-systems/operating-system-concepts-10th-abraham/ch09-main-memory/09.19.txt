9.19 Explain why address-space identifiers (ASIDs) are used in TLBs.

An ASID uniquely identifies each process and is used to provide address-space
protection for that process. When the TLB attempts to resolve virtual page
numbers, it ensures that the ASID for the currently running process matches the
ASID associated with the virtual page. If the ASIDs do not match, the attempt is
treated as a TLB miss. In addition to providing address-space protection, an
ASID allows the TLB to contain entries for several different processes
simultaneously. If the TLB does not support separate ASIDs, then every time a
new page table is selected (for instance, with each context switch), the TLB
must be flush to ensure that the next executing process does not use the
wrong translation information. Otherwise, the TLB could include old entries that
contain valid virtual addresses but have incorrect or invalid physical addresses
left over from the previous process.
