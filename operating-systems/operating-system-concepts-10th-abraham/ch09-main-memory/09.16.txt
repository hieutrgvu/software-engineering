9.16 On a system with paging, a process cannot access memory that it does not
own. Why? How could the operating system allow access to additional memory? Why
should it or should it not?

+ The physical address is obtained by frame number, which is found by logical
page number in page table, and offset. The OS controls the contents of this
table, so it can limit a process to accessing only those physical frames
allocated to the process. A process cannot refer to a page it does not own
because the page will not be in the page table.

+ To allow such access, OS may allow entries for non-process memory to be added
to the process's page table. Two or more processes' page tables can have the
entries point to a physical frame.

+ This is useful when two or more processes need to exchange data - they just
read and write to the same physical addresses, which may be at varying logical
addresses.

+ This also causes the process synchronization problems, e.g. a process writes
data when another process is reading.
