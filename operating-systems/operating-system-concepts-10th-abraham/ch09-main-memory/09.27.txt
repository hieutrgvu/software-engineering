9.27 Consider the IA-32 address-translation scheme shown in Figure 9.22.
a. Describe all the steps taken by the IA-32 in translating a logical address
into a physical address.
b. What are the advantages to the operating system of hardware that provides
such complicated memory translation?
c. Are there any disadvantages to this address-translation system? If so, what
are they? If not, why is this scheme not used by every manufacturer?

a. The selector is an index into the segment descriptor table. The segment
descriptor result plus the original offset is used to produce a linear address
with a dir, page, and offset. The dir is an index into a page directory. The
entry from the page directory selects the page table, and the page field is an
index into the page table. The entry from the page table, plus the offset, is
the physical address.

b. Such a page-translation mechanism offers the flexibility to allow most
operating systems to implement their memory scheme in hardware, instead of
having to implement some parts in hardware and some in software. Because it can
be done in hardware, it is more efficient (and the kernel is simpler).

c. Address translation can take longer due to the multiple table lookups it can
invoke. Caches help, but there will still be cache misses.
