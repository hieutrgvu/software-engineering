9.5 What is the effect of allowing two entries in a page table to point to
the same page frame in memory? Explain how this effect could be used to
decrease the amount of time needed to copy a large amount of memory from one
place to another. What effect would updating some byte on one page have on the
other page?

By allowing two entries in a page table to point to the same page frame in
memory, users can share code and data. This can apply for reentrant code such
as editor, compiler, linker, etc. When copying a large amount of memory from
one place to another, just copy the reentrant code once and make the entries
in page table point to it. This can save a lot of time.
