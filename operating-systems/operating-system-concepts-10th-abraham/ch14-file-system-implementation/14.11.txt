14.11 Some file systems allow disk storage to be allocated at different levels
of granularity. For instance, a file system could allocate 4 KB of disk space
as a single 4-KB block or as eight 512-byte blocks. How could we take advantage
of this flexibility to improve performance? What modifications would have to be
made to the free-space management scheme in order to support this feature?

This scheme decrease internal fragmentation. For example of 5.5KB, OS will
allocate 1 4-KB block and 3 512-byte blocks. 

In addition to maintaining a bitmap of free blocks, one would also have to
maintain extra state regarding which of the subblocks are currently being used
inside a block. The allocator can allocate subblocks and coallesce the
subblocks to obtain the larger block when all of the subblocks become free.
