14.16 Fragmentation on a storage device can be eliminated through compaction.
Typical disk devices do not have relocation or base registers (such as those
used when memory is to be compacted), so how can we relocate files? Give three
reasons why compacting and relocating files are often avoided.

Relocation of files on secondary storage involves considerable overhead â€” data
blocks would have to be read into main memory and written back out to their new
locations. Furthermore, relocation registers apply only to sequential files,
and many disk files are not sequential. For this same reason, many new files
will not require contiguous disk space; even sequential files can be allocated
noncontiguous blocks if links between logically sequential blocks are maintained
by the disk system.
