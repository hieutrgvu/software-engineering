14.17 Explain why logging metadata updates ensures recovery of a file system
after a file-system crash.

If the system crashes, the log file will contain zero or more transactions. Any
transactions it contains were not completed to the file system, even though they
were committed by the operating system, so they must now be completed. The
transactions can be executed from the pointer until the work is complete so that
the file-system structures remain consistent. The only problem occurs when a
transaction was aborted â€” that is, was not committed before the system crashed.
Any changes from such a transaction that were applied to the file system must
be undone, again preserving the consistency of the file system. This recovery
is all that is needed after a crash, eliminating any problems with consistency
checking.
