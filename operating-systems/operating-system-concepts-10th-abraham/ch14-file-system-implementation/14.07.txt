14.7 Consider a file system that uses a modified contiguous-allocation scheme
with support for extents. A file is a collection of extents, with each extent
corresponding to a contiguous set of blocks. A key issue in such systems is the
degree of variability in the size of the extents. What are the advantages and
disadvantages of the following schemes?
a. All extents are of the same size, and the size is predetermined.
b. Extents can be of any size and are allocated dynamically.
c. Extents can be of a few fixed sizes, and these sizes are predetermined.

a. It simplifies the block allocation scheme. A simple bit map or free list for
extents would suffice. However, it may increase internal fragmentation.

b. More complex allocation schemes are required. It might be difficult to find
an extent of the appropriate size and there might be external fragmentation.

c. One would have to maintain a separate bitmap or free list for each possible
size. This scheme is of intermediate complexity and of intermediate flexibility
in comparison to the earlier schemes.
