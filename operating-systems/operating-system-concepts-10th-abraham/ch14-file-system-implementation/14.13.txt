14.13 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of supporting links to files
that cross mount points (that is, the file link refers to a file that is stored
in a different volume).

The advantage is that there is greater transparency in the sense that the user
does not need to be aware of mount points and create links in all scenarios.
The disadvantage however is that the file system containing the link might be
mounted while the file system containing the target file might not be, and
therefore one cannot provide transparent access to the file in such a scenario;
the error condition would expose to the user that a link is a dead link and
that the link does indeed cross file system boundaries.
