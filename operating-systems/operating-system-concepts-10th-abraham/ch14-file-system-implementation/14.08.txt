14.8 Contrast the performance of the three techniques for allocating disk
blocks (contiguous, linked, and indexed) for both sequential and random file
access.

Contiguous
+ Sequential - Works very well as the file is stored contiguously. Sequential
access will simply involves traversing the contiguous disk blocks.
+ Random - Works very well as you can easily determine the adjacent disk block
containing the position you wish to seek to.

Linked
+ Sequential - Satisfactory as you are simply following the links from one
block to the next.
+ Random - Poor as it may require following the links to several disk blocks
until you arrive at the intended seek point of the file.

Indexed
+ Sequential - Works well as sequential access simply involves sequentially
accessing each index.
+ Random - Works well as it is easy to determine the index associated with the
disk block containing the position you wish to seek to
