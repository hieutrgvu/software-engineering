14.18 Consider the following backup scheme:
+ Day 1: Copy to a backup medium all files from the disk.
+ Day 2: Copy to an other medium all files changed since day 1.
+ Day 3: Copy to an other medium all files changed since day 1.
This differs from the schedule given in Section 14.7.4 by having all subsequent
backups copy all files modified since the first full backup. What are the
benefits of this system over the one in Section 14.7.4? What are the drawbacks?
Are restore operations made easier or more difficult? Explain your answer.

Advantage: More durable. If Day 2 data is corrupted, day 3 data can still used
to recover all system.

Disadvantage: Weak point in date 1 data. If date 1 data is corrupted, the
subsequent date stored is useless. In addition, it creases size due to
duplication backup.

Restores are easier because last backup tape can be picked, rather than the
full tape. No intermediate tapes need be read. More tape is used as more
files change.
