14.20 What are the implications of supporting UNIX consistency semantics for
shared access to files stored on remote file systems?

UNIX consistency semantics requires updates to a file to be immediately
available to other processes. Supporting such a semantics for shared files on
remote file systems could result in the following inefficiencies: all updates
by a client have to be immediately reported to the fileserver instead of being
batched (or even ignored if the updates are to a temporary file), and updates
have to be communicated by the fileserver to clients caching the data
immediately again resulting in more communication.
