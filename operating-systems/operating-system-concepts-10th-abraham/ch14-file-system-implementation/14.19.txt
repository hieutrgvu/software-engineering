14.19 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of associating with remote file
systems (stored on file servers) a set of failure semantics different from
those associated with local file systems.

The advantage is that the application can deal with the failure condition in a
more intelligent manner if it realizes that it incurred an error while accessing
a file stored in a remote file system. For instance, a file open operation could
simply fail instead of hanging when accessing a remote file on a failed server
and the application could deal with the failure in the best possible manner; if
the operation were simply to hang, then the entire application hangs, which is
not desirable. The disadvantage however is the lack of uniformity in failure
semantics and the resulting complexity in application code.
