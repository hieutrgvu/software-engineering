14.14 Consider a file system on a disk that has both logical and physical block
sizes of 512 bytes. Assume that the information about each file is already in
memory. For each of the three allocation strategies (contiguous, linked, and
indexed), answer these questions:
a. How is the logical-to-physical address mapping accomplished in this system?
(For the indexed allocation, assume that a file is always less than 512 blocks
long.)
b. If we are currently at logical block 10 (the last block accessed was block
10) and want to access logical block 4, how many physical blocks must be read
from the disk?

Let Z be the starting file address (block number).

1. Contiguous. Divide the logical address by 512 with X and Y the resulting
quotient and remainder respectively.
a. Add X to Z to obtain the physical block number. Y is the displacement into
that block.
b. 1

2. Linked. Divide the logical physical address by 511 with X and Y the
resulting quotient and remainder respectively.
a. Chase down the linked list (getting X + 1 blocks). Y + 1 is the displacement
into the last physical block.
b. 4

3. Indexed. Divide the logical address by 512 with X and Y the resulting
quotient and remainder respectively.
a. Get the index block into memory. Physical block address is contained in the
index block at location X. Y is the displacement into the desired physical
block.
b. 2
