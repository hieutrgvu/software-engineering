14.4 One problem with contiguous allocation is that the user must preallocate
enough space for each file. If the file grows to be larger than the space
allocated for it, special actions must be taken. One solution to this problem
is to define a file structure consisting of an initial contiguous area of a
specified size. If this area is filled, the operating system automatically
defines an overflow area that is linked to the initial contiguous area. If the
overflow area is filled, another overflow area is allocated. Compare this
implementation of a file with the standard contiguous and linked
implementations.

This method requires more overhead than standard contiguous implementation but
less overhead than linked implementation.
