+ Busy waiting means that a process/thread are looping to wait for a condition
to be satisfied without releasing the processor.

+ Another kind of waiting in OS is that process/thread will release the
processor and wait to be awakened in the future when the condition is satisfied.

+ Busy waiting can be avoided but switching context can have huge impact on
the system. It may not be avoided completely because the software uses atomic
hardware instructions, which usually requires busy waiting.
