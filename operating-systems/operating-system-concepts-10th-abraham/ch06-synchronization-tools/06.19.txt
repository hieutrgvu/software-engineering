6.19 Assume that a system has multiple processing cores. For each of the
following scenarios, describe which is a better locking mechanism â€” a spinlock
or a mutex lock where waiting processes sleep while waiting for the lock to
become available:

+ The lock is to be held for a short duration.
+ The lock is to be held for a long duration.
+ A thread may be put to sleep while holding the lock.

+ The lock is to be held for a short duration. -> spinlock
Spinlock is useful when process only wait for short duration which is less than
the context switching time. No context switch is required when a process must
wait on a lock so that one thread can "spin" on one processing core while
another thread performs its critical section on another core.

+ The lock is to be held for a long duration. -> mutex
There are no reason for a process wasting CPU time for a long duration. It can
sleep so that another process can ultilize the processor.

+ A thread may be put to sleep while holding the lock. -> mutex
Because the thread holding lock is put to blocked state, the lock is never
released until this thread is awaked and release lock. Therefore, the other
processes will wasting CPU time to wait the lock if using spinlock.
