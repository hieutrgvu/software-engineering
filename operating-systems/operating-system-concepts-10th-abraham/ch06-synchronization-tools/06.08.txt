6.8 Race conditions are possible in many computer systems. Consider an online
auction system where the current highest bid for each item must be maintained.
A person who wishes to bid on an item calls the bid(amount) function, which
compares the amount being bid to the current highest bid. If the amount exceeds
the current highest bid, the highest bid is set to the new amount. This is
illustrated below:

void bid(double amount) {
  if (amount > highestBid)
    highestBid = amount;
}

Describe how a race condition is possible in this situation and what might be
done to prevent the race condition from occurring.

+ Race condition: if two or more people bid at the same time with the amount
higher than the current highest bid, the last value to be saved is chosen
arbitrarily among their bid. The desired value shall be the the highest value
of these new bids.

+ Add the mutex as below:

void bid(double amount) {
  wait(mutex);

  if (amount > highestBid)
    highestBid = amount;

  signal(mutex);
}
