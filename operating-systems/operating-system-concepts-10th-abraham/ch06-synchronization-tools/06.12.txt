6.12 Some semaphore implementations provide a function getValue() that returns
the current value of a semaphore. This function may, for instance, be invoked
prior to calling wait() so that a process will only call wait() if the value of
the semaphore is > 0, thereby preventing blocking while waiting for the
semaphore. For example:

if (getValue(&sem) > 0)
  wait(&sem);

Many developers argue against such a function and discourage its use. Describe
a potential problem that could occur when using the function getValue() in this
scenario.

The processes waiting for a semaphore are added to a list. Depending on the
policy, e.g. FIFO, OS will wake a process when the semaphore is released. Thus,
using getValue() before call wait() may lead to starvation in high contention.
