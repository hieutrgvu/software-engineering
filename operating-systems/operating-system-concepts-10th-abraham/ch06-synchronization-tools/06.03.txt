6.3 Explain why spinlocks are not appropriate for single-processor systems yet
are often used in multiprocessor systems.

+ The spinlock requires busy waiting. Therefore, in a real multiprogramming
system, where a single CPU core is shared among many processes, it wastes CPU
cycles that some other process might be able to use productively.

+ Spinlocks do have an advantage in that no context switch is required when a
process must wait on a lock, and a context switch may take considerable time.
In multicore/multiprocessor systems, spinlocks are the preferable choice for
locking. If a lock is to be held for a short duration, one thread can "spin" on
one processing core while another thread performs its critical section on
another core.
