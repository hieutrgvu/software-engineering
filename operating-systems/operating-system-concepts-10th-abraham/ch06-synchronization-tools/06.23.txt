6.23 Servers can be designed to limit the number of open connections. For
example, a server may wish to have only N socket connections at any point in
time. As soon as N connections are made, the server will not accept another
incoming connection until an existing connection is released. Illustrate how
semaphores can be used by a server to limit the number of concurrent
connections.

A semaphore is initialized to the number of allowed socket connection, e.g. N.
When there are a requesting connection, acquire() will be invoked. If acquire()
succeeds (the semaphore is greater than zero before acquire), the server will
accept the connection, otherwise it can reject the connection. When a connection
is released, release() method will be invoked to increase the semaphore
variable by 1.
