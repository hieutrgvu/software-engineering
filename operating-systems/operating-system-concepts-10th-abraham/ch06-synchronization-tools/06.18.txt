6.18 The implementation of mutex locks provided in Section 6.5 suffers from
busy waiting. Describe what changes would be necessary so that a process
waiting to acquire a mutex lock would be blocked and placed into a waiting
queue until the lock became available.

To overcome the busy waiting problem, we can modify the definition of the
acquire() and release() operations as follows: When a process executes the
acquire() operation and finds that the mutex value is not true, it must wait.
However, rather than engaging in busy waiting, the process can suspend itself.
The suspend operation places a process into a waiting queue associated with the
mutex, and the state of the process is switched to the waiting state. Then
control is transferred to the CPU scheduler, which selects another process to
execute.
