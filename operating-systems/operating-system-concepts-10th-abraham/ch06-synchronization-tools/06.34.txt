6.34 The decrease_count() function in the previous exercise currently returns 0
if sufficient resources are available and âˆ’1 otherwise. This leads to awkward
programming for a process that wishes to obtain a number of resources:

while (decrease_count(count) == -1)
  ;

Rewrite the resource-manager code segment using a monitor and condition
variables so that the decrease_count() function suspends the process until
sufficient resources are available. This will allow a process to invoke
decrease_count() by simply calling

decrease_count(count);

The process will return from this function call only when sufficient resources
are available.
