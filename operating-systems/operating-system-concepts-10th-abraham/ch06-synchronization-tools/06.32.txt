6.32 Discuss ways in which the priority inversion problem could be addressed in
a real-time system. Also discuss whether the solutions could be implemented
within the context of a proportional share scheduler.

Typically, priority inversion is avoided by implementing a priority-inheritance
protocol. According to this protocol, all processes that are accessing resources
needed by a higher-priority process inherit the higher priority until they are
finished with the resources in question. When they are finished, their
priorities revert to their original values. In the example above, a
priority-inheritance protocol would allow process L to temporarily inherit the
priority of process H, thereby preventing process M from preempting its
execution. When process L had finished using resource S, it would relinquish its
inherited priority from H and assume its original priority. Because resource S
would now be available, process H — not M — would run next.
