10.11 You have devised a new page-replacement algorithm that you think may be
optimal. In some contorted test cases, Belady's anomaly occurs. Is the new
algorithm optimal? Explain your answer.

[Internet] No. An optimal algorithm will not suffer from Belady's anomaly
because —by definition—an optimal algorithm replaces the page that will not be
used for the longest time. Belady's anomaly occurs when a page - replacement
algorithm evicts a page that will be needed in the immediate future. An optimal
algorithm would not have selected such a page.

[Hieu Vu] Belady's anomaly occurs when the number of frames increases but the
fault rate also increases. The optimal approach should work better if the number
of frames increases.
