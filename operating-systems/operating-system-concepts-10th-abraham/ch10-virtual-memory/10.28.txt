10.28 The KHIE (pronounced “k-hi”) operating system uses a FIFO replacement
algorithm for resident pages and a free-frame pool of recently used pages.
Assume that the free-frame pool is managed using the LRU replacement policy.
Answer the following questions:
a. If a page fault occurs and the page does not exist in the free-frame pool,
how is free space generated for the newly requested page?
b. If a page fault occurs and the page exists in the free-frame pool, how are
the resident page set and the free-frame pool managed to make space for the
requested page?
c. To what does the system degenerate if the number of resident pages is set
to one?
d. To what does the system degenerate if the number of pages in the free-frame
pool is zero?

a. When a page fault occurs and if the page does not exist in the free-frame
pool, then one of the pages in the free-frame pool is evicted to disk, creating
space for one of the resident pages to be moved to the free-frame pool. The
accessed page is then moved to the resident set.

b. When a page fault occurs and if the page exists in the free-frame pool, then
it is moved into the set of resident pages, while one of the resident pages is
moved to the free-frame pool.

c. When the number of resident pages is set to one, then the system degenerates
into the page replacement algorithm used in the free-frame pool, which is
typically managed in a LRU fashion.

d. When the number of pages in the free-frame pool is zero, then the system
degenerates into a FIFO page-replacement algorithm.
