10.39 Consider the parameter Δ used to define the working-set window in the
working-set model. When Δ is set to a low value, what is the effect on the
page-fault frequency and the number of active (nonsuspended) processes currently
executing in the system? What is the effect when Δ is set to a very high value?

+ When Δ is set to small value, the working set may be small too. This causes
a large number of page fault, and the number of active processes may decreases
due to thrashing.

+ When Δ is set to large value, the working set may contains a lot of page
numbers including unnecessary pages. This reduce the number of page faults but
also reduce the degree of multiprogramming.
