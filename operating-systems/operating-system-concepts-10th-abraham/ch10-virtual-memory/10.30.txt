faults.

+ A major page fault occurs when a page is referenced and the page is not in
memory. Servicing a major page fault requires reading the desired page from
the backing store into a free frame and updating the page table. Demand paging
typically generates an initially high rate of major page faults.

+ Minor page faults occur when a process does not have a logical mapping to a
page, yet that page is in memory, e.g. reference to a shared library, or
reclaimed but placed on the free frame list.

+ When this minor page fault occurs, the frame is removed from the free-frame
list and reassigned to the process. As might be expected, resolving a minor page
fault is typically much less time consuming than resolving a major page fault.
