10.42 The slab-allocation algorithm uses a separate cache for each different
object type. Assuming there is one cache per object type, explain why this
scheme doesn't scale well with multiple CPUs. What could be done to address
this scalability issue?

This has long been a problem with the slab allocator â€” poor scalability with
multiple CPUs. The issue comes from having to lock the global cache when it is
being access. This has the effect of serializing cache accesses on
multiprocessor systems. Solaris has addressed this by introducing a per-CPU
cache, rather than a single global cache. Linux has addressed this by SLUB.
