10.29 Consider a demand-paging system with the following time-measured
utilizations:

CPU utilization 20%
Paging disk 97.7%
Other I/O devices 5%

For each of the following, indicate whether it will (or is likely to) improve
CPU utilization. Explain your answers.

a. Install a faster CPU.
b. Install a bigger paging disk.
c. Increase the degree of multiprogramming.
d. Decrease the degree of multiprogramming.
e. Install more main memory.
f. Install a faster hard disk or multiple controllers with multiple hard disks.
g. Add prepaging to the page-fetch algorithms.
h. Increase the page size.

a. No, because thrashing occurs.
b. No, because process are waiting for I/O. It needs speed not capacity.
c. No, because thrashing occurs.
d. Yes, more free pages for running processes.
e. Yes, amore pages can remain resident and not require paging to or from the
disks.
f. Yes, because IO speed is the bottleneck.
g. Yes, the CPU get more data faster.
h. Not certain. If sequential data is accessed, it will improve. However, random
data is accessed, it will make the situation worse.
