10.13 Consider a demand-paged computer system where the degree of multi-
programming is currently fixed at four. The system was recently measured to
determine utilization of the CPU and the paging disk. Three alternative results
are shown below. For each case, what is happening? Can the degree of multi-
programming be increased to increase the CPU utilization? Is the paging helping?
a. CPU utilization 13 percent; disk utilization 97 percent
b. CPU utilization 87 percent; disk utilization 3 percent
c. CPU utilization 13 percent; disk utilization 3 percent

a. Thrashing; Cannot increase the degree of multiprogramming, and paging is not
helping.
b. CPU utilization is high, but increasing the degree of multiprogramming may
cause thrashing.
c. CPU utilization is low, and the system has light workload. The degree of
multiprogramming can be increased to achieve better CPU utilization.
