+ When page replacement occurs too much, the CPU utilization decreases. Due to
CPU utilization decrement, OS introduces new process to increase the degree
of multiprogramming. The new process tries to get started by taking frames from
running processes, causing more page faults and a longer queue for the paging
device. As a result, CPU utilization drops even further, and the CPU scheduler
tries to increase the degree of multiprogramming even more.

+ The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as
compared to the level of multiprogramming, e.g. CPU utilization is low, but
the level of multiprogramming is high.

+ It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming.
