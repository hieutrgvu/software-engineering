10.43 Consider a system that allocates pages of different sizes to its
processes. What are the advantages of such a paging scheme? What modifications
to the virtual memory system would be needed to provide this functionality?

The program could have a large code segment or use large-sized arrays as data.
These portions of the program could be allocated to larger pages, thereby
decreasing the memory overheads associated with a page table. The virtual
memory system would then have to maintain multiple free lists of pages for the
different sizes and also needs to have more complex code for address translation
to take into account different page sizes
