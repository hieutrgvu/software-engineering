10.12 Segmentation is similar to paging but uses variable-sized “pages.”
Define two segment-replacement algorithms, one based on the FIFO page-
replacement scheme and the other on the LRU page-replacement scheme.
Remember that since segments are not the same size, the segment that is chosen
for replacement may be too small to leave enough consecutive locations for the
needed segment. Consider strategies for systems where segments cannot be
relocated and strategies for systems where they can.

+ FIFO: Find the oldest segment large enough to satisfy the incoming segment.
If no segment is large enough, select a group of contiguous segments which are
closest to the oldest of the list and satisfy the new segment in case of no
relocation, or rearrange a group of N oldest segments which is large enough to
a contiguous memory in case of relocation. Add any leftover space to the free-
space list in both cases.

+ LRU: Select the least recent used (LRU) segment that is large enough. If no
segment satisfies, select a group of contiguous segments which are closest to
the LRU of the list in case of no relocation, or rearrange a group of N LRU
segments to a contiguous memory in case of relocation. Add any leftover space to
the free-space list in both cases.
