10.23 When a page fault occurs, the process requesting the page must block
while waiting for the page to be brought from disk into physical memory. Assume
that there exists a process with five user-level threads and that the mapping of
user threads to kernel threads is many to one. If one user thread incurs a page
fault while accessing its stack, would the other user threads belonging to the
same process also be affected by the page faultâ€”that is, would they also have to
wait for the faulting page to be brought into memory? Explain.

Because the mapping of user threads to kernel threads is many to one, the kernel
will treat all threads belonging to a process as one process. Therefore, if
a user thread incurs a page fault, the other user threads belongings to the
same process also be affected and have to wait for the faulting page to be
brought into memory.
