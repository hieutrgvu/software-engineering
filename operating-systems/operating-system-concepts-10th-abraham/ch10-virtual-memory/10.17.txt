10.17 Consider a system that uses pure demand paging.
a. When a process first starts execution, how would you characterize
the page-fault rate?
b. Once the working set for a process is loaded into memory, how would you
characterize the page-fault rate?
c. Assume that a process changes its locality and the size of the new working
set is too large to be stored in available free memory. Identify some options
system designers could choose from to handle this situation.

a. The page-fault rate will be quite high initially because no pages are loaded
into memory.
b. The page-fault rate will be quite low as all necessary pages are loaded
into memory.
c.
+ Terminate process.
+ Get more physical memory.
+ Reclaim pages more aggressively.
