10.34 Suppose that your replacement policy (in a paged system) is to examine
each page regularly and to discard that page if it has not been used since the
last examination. What would you gain and what would you lose by using this
policy rather than LRU or second-chance replacement?

This algorithm can be implemented by a reference bit. Each examination cycle,
all reference is clear and only set if its page is referenced. The pages have
the reference bit 0 will be selected arbitrarily to replace.

The advantage of this algorithm is simplicity. However, the disadvantage is
that it ignores the locality by using only a short time frame for selecting
the victim.
