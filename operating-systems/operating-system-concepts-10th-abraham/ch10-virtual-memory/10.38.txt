10.38 Is it possible for a process to have two working sets, one representing
data and another representing code? Explain.

[Internet] Yes, in fact many processors provide two TLBs for this very reason.
As an example, the code being accessed by a process may retain the same working
set for a long period of time. However, the data the code accesses may change,
thus reflecting a change in the working set for data accesses.

We can make 2 lists, one for instruction fetching and one for data access and
use one or 2 window to monitor the working sets. The instruction working set
will only contain the pages in which the instruction is fetched, and vice versa
for data working set.
