10.32 Suppose that a machine provides instructions that can access memory
locations using the one-level indirect addressing scheme. What sequence of page
faults is incurred when all of the pages of a program are currently nonresident
and the first instruction of the program is an indirect memory-load operation?
What happens when the operating system is using a per-process frame allocation
technique and only two pages are allocated to this process?

+ In the worse case, there are 3 page faults, one for the first instruction, one
for the base address and one for the target memory, whose address is specified
by the offset and base address.

+ If there are only 2 pages are allocated to this process, the first instruction
cannot be completed if it need to be re-fetched.
