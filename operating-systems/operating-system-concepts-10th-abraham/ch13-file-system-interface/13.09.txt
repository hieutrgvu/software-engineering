13.9 Consider a file system in which a file can be deleted and its disk space
reclaimed while links to that file still exist. What problems may occur if a new
file is created in the same storage area or with the same absolute path name?
How can these problems be avoided?

The remaining file pointers contain actual disk addresses, and the space is
subsequently reused for other files, these dangling pointers may point into the
middle of other files. Some applications use this pointer as it's never deleted.
So these applications receive wrong file or may modified the file deleted.
Another problem is security, users think their files are gone along with
sensitive information but actually this data still exists.

If the file entry itself is deleted, the space for the file is deallocated,
leaving the links dangling. We can search for these links and remove them as
well, but unless a list of the associated links is kept with each file, this
search can be expensive. Alternatively, we can leave the links until an attempt
is made to use them. At that time, we can determine that the file of the name
given by the link does not exist and can fail to resolve the link name; the
access is treated just as with any other illegal file name.
