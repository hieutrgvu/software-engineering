13.2 Why do some systems keep track of the type of a file, while still others
leave it to the user and others simply do not implement multiple file types?
Which system is “better”?

Some systems allow different file operations based on the type of the file,
e.g. an ASCII file can be read as a stream while a database file can be read
via an index to a block. Other systems leave such interpretation of a file's
data to the process and provide no help in accessing the data. The method that
is better depends on the needs of the processes on the system, and the demands
the users place on the operating system. If a system runs mostly databased
applications, it may be more efficient for the operating system to implement a
database-type file and provide operations, rather than making each program
implement the same thing (possibly in different ways). For general-purpose
systems it may be better to only implement basic file types to keep the OS size
smaller and allow maximum freedom to the processes on the system.
