13.7 Consider a system that supports 5,000 users. Suppose that you want to
allow 4,990 of these users to be able to access one file.
a. How would you specify this protection scheme in UNIX?
b. Can you suggest another protection scheme that can be used more effectively
for this purpose than the scheme provided by UNIX?

a. There are two methods for achieving this
i. Create an access control list with the names of all 4990 users.
ii. Put these 4990 users in one group and set the group access accordingly. This
scheme cannot always be implemented since user groups are restricted by the
system.

b. The universal access to files applies to all users unless their nameappears
in the access-control list with different access permission. With this scheme
you simply put the names of the remaining ten users in the access control list
but with no access privileges allowed.
