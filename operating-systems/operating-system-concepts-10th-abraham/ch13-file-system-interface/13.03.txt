13.3 Similarly, some systems support many types of structures for a fileâ€™s
data, while others simply support a stream of bytes. What are the advantages
and disadvantages of each approach?

An advantages of having the system support different file structures is that
the support comes from the system; individual applications are not required to
provide the support. This save a lot of memory when tons of applications using
the same file structure. In addition, the OS can implement the support more
efficiently than an application. The cons of having OS supporting this is that
it increases the size of the OS. Moreover, applications that may require
different file types other than what is provided by the system may not be able
to run on such system.

An alternative strategy is for the OS to difine no support for file structures
and instead treat all files as a series of bytes. This is the approach taken by
UNIX systems. The advantage of this approach is that it simplifies the OS
support for file systems, as the system no longer has to provide the structure
for different file types. Furthermore, it is flexible to allow applications to
define their own file structures.
