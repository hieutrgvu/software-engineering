13.4 Could you simulate a multilevel directory structure with a single-level
directory structure in which arbitrarily long names can be used? If your answer
is yes, explain how you can do so, and contrast this scheme with the multilevel
directory scheme. If your answer is no, explain what prevents your simulation’s
success. How would your answer change if file names were limited to seven
characters?

Yes. We can treat long names as file path in multilevel directory. The "level"
in single-level directory can be separated by "/". For example, we can translate
a multilevel directory like

root
├── andrew
│   ├── doc
│   ├── music
│   └── study
└── hieuvu
    ├── misc
    ├── study
    └── test

to a single-level directory like

root/andrew/doc
root/andrew/music
root/andrew/study
root/hieuvu/misc
root/hieuvu/study
root/hieuvu/test

With 7-character filename, there is an limitation of numbers of files. So, we
cannot simulate a multilevel directory structure with a single-level directory
structure with this situation.
