13.10 The open-file table is used to maintain information about files that are
currently open. Should the operating system maintain a separate table for each
user or maintain just one table that contains references to files that are
currently being accessed by all users? If the same file is being accessed by two
different programs or users, should there be separate entries in the open-file
table? Explain.

The OS should maintain one table that contains references to files that are
currently being accessed by all users. Because it is easy to specify what
file are sharing and used among all users. It centralizes all information to one
place so it will increase searching, manipulating file performance.

If the same file is being accessed by two different programs or users, there
should be 1 entry in the open-file table. Just maintain the user list in this
entry. It increase the performance of access control (mutex, semaphore, etc.).
The OS can close the file when there are no users open the file.
