13.13 Some systems automatically open a file when it is referenced for the first
time and close the file when the job terminates. Discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of this scheme compared with the more traditional one, where the
user has to open and close the file explicitly.

Advantages: Automatic opening and closing of files relieves the user from the
invocation of these functions, and thus makes it more convenient to the user.
Some user may foget to close the file after finishing.

Disadvantages: Some operations such as searching, deleting do not required to
open the file. Opening file by default will comsume the resource meaningless.
