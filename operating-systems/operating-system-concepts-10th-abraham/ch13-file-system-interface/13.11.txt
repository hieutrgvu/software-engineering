Advantages: There will be less mistakes on using lock. Because there are a lot
of programs want to access 1 file. Each program must guarentee it use the lock
probably and not occupied the access for an unaccepted time.

Disavantages: In many cases, separate programs might be willing to tolerate
concurrent access to a file without requiring the need to obtain locks and
thereby guaranteeing mutual exclusion to the files. In such situations, the
mandatory locks would limit the flexibility in how files could be accessed and
might also increase the overheads associated with accessing files.
